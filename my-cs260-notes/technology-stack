## AWS 

### EC2 service -- renting a server (and its IP address)
Used to rent a server -- access by IP address, make elastic IP

### Route 53
AWS service that handles everything DNS-related (buy domain name, host your domain on their DNS servers, create DNS records)
Why Domain name:
* referring to server by IP address is fine for development, but not for most users
* HTTPS requires a Domain name

#### DNS Records
http://www.google.com
protocol sub domain. **domain name. top-level domain  (Root Domain, part you register)**

- `A` record maps domain names to IP addresses  (we create 2 A records.  to our root domain as well as * wild card for sub domains)
- `CNAME` maps domain names to other domain names
-  The name server `(NS)` record contains the names of the authoritative name servers that authorize you to place DNS records in this DNS server
-  The start of authority `(SOA)` record provides contact information about the owner of this domain name.
